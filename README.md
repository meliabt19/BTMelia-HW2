# Homework Overview: Note #1
In this assignment, I was able to succesfully orient all the neccesary features of the grids, but definitely require further practice to make them cleaner. Im still continuing to figure out the responsiveness to make sure they fit under all parameters. The project overall dispalys who I am, the upcoming projects, and a contact page (currently not working but will be modified in the future to do so).
